A full-stack application that brings vinyl collections to life by combining RFID scanning with a gamified reward system and real-time updates.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** May 2025

Vinylify was designed to make managing physical music collections seamless and interactive. Using RFID tags and an ESP32 reader, users can scan vinyl records to instantly update their digital library and unlock rewards.

## Key Features

### Backend
- Built REST APIs with Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL/Prisma
- Real-time processing of RFID scans with duplicate detection
- Secure authentication and session handling via NextAuth.js & JWT

### Frontend
- Developed with Next.js/React for responsive, real-time interaction
- Integrated live scanning demos and instant recognition features
- Chatbot-style interface for user engagement

### Gamification
- Reward system logic: first-time bonuses, rare edition rewards, daily challenges
- Encourages frequent user interaction and collection growth

## Technical Approach

The system combines hardware and software integration, using RFID technology to bridge the physical and digital worlds. The ESP32 microcontroller processes RFID scans and communicates with the web application in real-time, while the gamification system keeps users engaged with their collections.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware & Backend:** RFID RC522, ESP32, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, NextAuth.js, JWT
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Testing:** Cypress

## Impact

This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software, blending IoT with modern web technologies. By combining RFID scanning, gamification, and secure authentication, Vinylify shows creativity and technical skill in building engaging user experiences.
