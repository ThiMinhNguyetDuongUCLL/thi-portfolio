A Space Invaders-inspired video game with a unique "mine shower" twist, developed using Python and Pygame library with focus on GUI design and team collaboration.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** September - November 2023

From September to November 2023, I had the thrilling experience of developing the Retired Spaceship video game using Python and the Pygame library. Our team aimed to create an engaging game that mimicked the classic style of Space Invaders, with an exciting twist of navigating through a "mine shower."
