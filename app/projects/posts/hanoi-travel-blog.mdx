A dynamic travel blog website dedicated to Hanoi, showcasing Vietnamese culture and traditional cuisines through an immersive web experience.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** October 2023

In October 2023, I embarked on an exciting project to develop a dynamic travel blog website dedicated to Hanoi, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React JS. This was my very first personal project in front-end development, and I chose Hanoi, my hometown city and also the capital of Vietnam, to be the topic of my website.
