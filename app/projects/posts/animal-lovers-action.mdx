A mobile game prototype that combines entertainment with education about animal care and welfare, featuring donation features and real-world animal center visits.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** March 2024

In March 2024, I had the fantastic opportunity to lead a team of five in developing an engaging mobile game prototype called Animal Aid, using Figma. Our mission was clear: create a fun, user-friendly game that not only entertains but also educates users about animal care and welfare.
